## MIUUL Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project
This repository contains all the Python code developed for my final project as part of the MIUUL Data Analytics Bootcamp. It includes both the original script files and the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) version of the project.

All code was written by me from scratch.
The project showcases data analysis, manipulation, feature engineering and visualization, using various Python libraries and techniques.
